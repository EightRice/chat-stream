# Chat Stream – Trustless Business Repository

## Introduction
Chat Stream is a real‑time pipeline that ingests up to 20 chat messages per second, buckets them, runs low‑latency models for sentiment and abstractive summarization, and emits condensed “community snapshots”. It targets live streams, multiplayer games, and town‑hall calls where stakeholders must grasp collective sentiment at a glance.  

## Repository Structure
- **TERMS.md** – legally binding scope, deliverables, payments, and dispute rules for this project.
- **src/** – prototype Python streaming loop, modular model wrappers, and hot‑swap interface.
- **submissions/** – final deliverables, performance logs, and any files required by the arbiter.

## Using This Repository
Project creators clone the repo, adjust `TERMS.md`, and deploy bounties.  
Contractors fork, develop in `src/`, and submit pull requests plus artifacts in `submissions/`. Disputes fall back to `TERMS.md` and commit history. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
