# Chat Stream – Real‑Time Community‑Sentiment Synthesizer

We live in an age where a single live‑stream can generate tens of thousands of chat messages per hour. Human moderators, analysts, and even streamers themselves cannot keep up, let alone spot the actionable threads of agreement, dissent, or fresh ideas hidden inside the torrent. **Chat Stream turns that flood into a rolling, two‑sentence “headline” with an explicit sentiment bar and a confidence score, refreshing twice per second.** The result is a heads‑up display for large‑scale conversation: producers get instant feedback loops, viewers see that their voice contributes, and downstream dashboards can trigger alerts or overlay statistics in real time.

### Value Proposition
*   **Speed & Scale** – Handles a sustained 20 messages/second (100× a typical Twitch chat) on commodity hardware or a medium cloud instance.  
*   **Transparency** – Outputs a confidence score plus exposure of raw bucket summaries for auditability—no black‑box claims.  
*   **Modularity** – Models are hot‑swappable at runtime; choose open‑weights offline models for privacy or paid LLM APIs for peak quality.  
*   **Cost Control** – Bucketing and fractal aggregation keep inference calls proportional to message entropy rather than volume, driving down token spend by 90 % in stress tests.  
*   **Interoperability** – Emits both JSON and WebSocket streams for easy overlay in OBS, Discord bots, or custom dashboards.
